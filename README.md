# Kitchen-Order-Project-with-React

In this project, I created a kitchen - order syste with MERN Stack, MDBBootstrap, Reactstrap and Bootstrap. 

You can choose your meeting room and then give orders with select - options. Orders will be saved in mongoDB with room info, creation time & date and activeness info. 

In kitchen page you can view the active orders. If you click the button then the order will be deactive but won't be deleted from the database because in the end of the month; you would want to see your expenses. However, when you click the button 
the order will be deleted from the page.

In this project, I have learned countless information about React, Node.js, MongoDB, programming, design, socket.io, websocket and more ...
